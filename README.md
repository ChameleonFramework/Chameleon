## How can does use Chameleon?
As this is hard to explain, we have created [an example project](https://github.com/HyperaOfficial/ChameleonProject). In short, you have a common module with non-platform-specific code (this would only be Chameleon code), then you have a module for each platform you'd like to support.
You can also check out our [development roadmap](DEVELOPMENT.md) or various examples for [BungeeCord support](Platforms/BungeeCord/README.md), [Spigot support](Platforms/Spigot/README.md), [Velocity support](Platforms/Velocity/README.md) and [Minestom support](Platforms/Minestom/README.md) for reference.

## What platform Chameleon can support?
Here is a TODO list of all the platforms we'd like to support. If you have any suggestions you can post them on our [feedback site](https://feedback.hypera.dev).
* [x] BungeeCord
* [x] Spigot
* [x] Velocity
* [x] Minestom
