### What is Chameleon?
Chameleon is a library created to make creating cross-platform Minecraft plugins as simple and easy as possible.


### Supported Platforms
Chameleon plans to support every platform in this list. If you have ideas for other platforms that we could support, please suggest them on our [Official Feedback Site][Feedback].
* [x] [BungeeCord]
* [x] [Spigot]
* [x] [Velocity]
* [x] [Minestom]
* [ ] [Sponge]

### How do I use Chameleon?
As this is hard to explain, we have created an [Example Project][Example]. In short, you have a common module with non-platform-specific code (this would only be Chameleon code), then you have a module for each platform you would like to support.  
You can also check out our [Development Roadmap][Roadmap] or various examples of [BungeeCord support][BungeeCord-project], [Spigot support][Spigot-project], [Velocity support][Velocity-project] and [Minestom support][Minestom-project] for reference.
