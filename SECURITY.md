## Chameleon Security Policy

This document outlines how Chameleon's maintainers plan to handle any Security Vulnerabilities.

We provide security patches for the latest release.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability in Chameleon, please either:
- [Create a vulnerability report on GitHub](https://github.com/ChameleonFramework/Chameleon/security/advisories/new).
- Email [security@hypera.dev](mailto:security@hypera.dev).

When a security vulnerability is reported, we will investigate the vulnerability, and it's impact, then work on a fix.  
We will credit those who report security vulnerabilities responsibly when publishing a Security Advisory.
